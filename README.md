cgshares
========

Calculate the cpu shares of the cgroups on a system

./cgshares will show all the cgroups that have processes associated with them and the calculated percentage of cpu this guarantees them

./cgshares -a shows all the cgroups and their percentage of cpu if they all had at least one process associated.
